Our shared goal is to investigate the cultural and ideological stakes of the musical by focusing in a systematic fashion on the genreâ€™s essential elements: music, dance, and spectacle as combined in the musical number as a vehicle of cinematic meaning." />

Our long term goal is to include as many films as possible in the database, creating a resource for project members, and eventually other scholars and students, to study the film musical from a variety of corpus studies approaches." />
